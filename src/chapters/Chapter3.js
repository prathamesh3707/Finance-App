        <h1> Mutual Funds</h1>

        <p>
          <h3>What are mutual funds?</h3>
          It is a trust that gathers cash from various financial backers who
          share a typical venture objective. Then, at that point, it puts the
          cash in values, securities, currency market instruments as well as
          different securities. Every financial backer possesses units, which
          address a part of the property of the asset. The pay/gains produced
          from this aggregate venture is appropriated proportionately among the
          financial backers subsequent to deducting specific costs, by working
          out a plan's <b>"Net Asset Value'' or NAV</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h3>What is NAV? </h3>
          The performance of a particular scheme of a Mutual Fund is denoted by
          Net Asset Value (NAV). In simple words, NAV is the market value of the
          securities held by the scheme. Mutual Funds invest the money collected
          from investors in securities markets. Since market value of securities
          changes every day, NAV of a scheme also varies on a day to day basis.

          <h3> Why is investing better than saving?</h3>
          In order to accumulate large sums to meet one’s financial goals, in
          order to beat inflation, one must take certain investment risks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h3> When should you start investing in mutual funds?</h3>
          There is no minimum age when one can start investing. The moment one
          starts earning and saving, one can start investing in Mutual Funds. In
          fact, even kids can open their investment accounts with Mutual Funds
          out of the money they receive once in a while in the form of gifts
          during their birthdays or festivals. Similarly, there is no upper age
          for investing in Mutual Funds.
        </p>
        <p>
          <h3> Mutual Funds vs Shares</h3>
          Direct investment in shares carries a relatively higher risk element.
          You need to pick stocks by researching the company and sector. It’s a
          humongous task to choose a few companies from thousands of them listed
          on the stock exchange. Once done, you need to keep a track of every
          stock's performance. In Mutual Funds, the stock picking is done by
          expert fund managers. You need to keep track of the performance of the
          fund and not individual stocks within the fund. They also allow
          investment flexibility unlike stocks, with growth/dividend options,
          top-ups, systematic withdrawals/transfer, etc. besides helping to ride
          over volatility by investing small amounts regularly through SIPs.

            To elaborate, we invest in various investment avenues based on our
            requirements, e.g. for capital growth - we invest in equity shares,
            for safety of capital and regular income - we buy fixed income
            products.
          </p>

            To manage investments, one can outsource certain tasks one is unable
            to do. Anyone can outsource ‘managing one’s investments’ to a
            professional firm – the Mutual Fund company. Mutual Funds offer
            various avenues to fulfill different objectives, which investors can
            choose from based on one’s unique situation and objective.

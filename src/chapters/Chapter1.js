        <h1>Cryptocurrencies</h1>

        <p>
          Cryptocurrencies, or virtual currencies, are digital means of exchange
          created and used by private individuals or groups. Usually built using
          blockchain technology, Cryptocurrencies are almost always designed to
          be free from government manipulation and control.
        </p>

        <p>
          Cryptocurrency's technical foundations date back to the early 1980s
          when an American cryptographer named David Chaum conceived an
          anonymous cryptographic electronic money called Ecash. Twelve years
          later, in 1995, he implemented it through Digicash. However, the first
          time the idea or term "Cryptocurrency" was coined was in 1998.
